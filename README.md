# Building a REST API with Node.js

In this module we will develop a **API RESTful**, but this time using *Fastify, Knex, TypeScript* and other tools to help during the development.

## [Fastify](https://www.fastify.io/)

### Fast and low overhead web framework, for Node.js

An efficient server implies a lower cost of the infrastructure, a better responsiveness under load and happy users. How can you efficiently handle the resources of your server, knowing that you are serving the highest number of requests possible, without sacrificing security validations and handy development?

## [knex.js](https://knexjs.org/)

### Knex.js -> SQL query builder

Knex.js (pronounced /kəˈnɛks/) is a "batteries included" SQL query builder for PostgreSQL, CockroachDB, MSSQL, MySQL, MariaDB, SQLite3, Better-SQLite3, Oracle, and Amazon Redshift designed to be flexible, portable, and fun to use.

## [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) {Not will be used! ⚠️}

Jest is a delightful JavaScript Testing Framework with a focus on simplicity.

It works with projects using: [Babel](https://babeljs.io/), [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), [Node](https://nodejs.org/), [React](https://reactjs.org/), [Angular](https://angular.io/), [Vue](https://vuejs.org/) and more!

## [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/)

Blazing Fast Unit Test Framework

A Vite-native unit test framework. It's fast!
